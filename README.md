# snippets-and-docs
A place for all the notes and snippets I canâ€™t remember, like a blog but less blog-y

There's lots of languages I deal with so this is roughly split by language or topic: some things (like [handling BOM removal](bash/bom.md)) or [tdd](tdd/tips_and_techniques.md) may turn up in all sorts of coding contexts.

If you want to use some of these snippets or ideas, fill your boots (with CC-BY-4.0 unless otherwise referenced)
